# Portfolio
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am an experienced technical writer with a strong background in creating clear and concise documentation for software projects. With a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of complex technical concepts, I specialize in producing design documents, user manuals, API documents, installation guides, and release notes. Through my work, I aim to empower users and developers by providing them with comprehensive and user-friendly documentation. Below are some samples of my work, that give an idea of my style and skills.
## Design Documents
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These documents contain sensitive information owned by the company and are subject to strict confidentiality agreements. However, I would be more than happy to provide you with a sample template that I have personally worked on. This template can give you a general idea of the design elements and structure that I have experience with. While it may not encompass the specific details of the confidential documents, it can still serve as a helpful reference to understand my work.

## API Documents
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although I don't have extensive experience with API documentation, I am a dedicated self-learner who has taken the initiative to explore this field. Recently, I have been teaching myself API documentation techniques and tools, including Swagger. I even created a sample API documentation using Swagger and successfully published it. This hands-on experience has fueled my enthusiasm and passion for API documentation. I am a proactive individual who actively seeks opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in this domain. As an avid learner, I am excited to continue exploring and mastering API documentation to contribute effectively in this field.

## Release Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------
Included in my portfolio is a sample of release notes, showcasing my proficiency in creating clear and concise documentation for software releases. The release notes provide a comprehensive overview of new features, enhancements, bug fixes, and known issues for a specific software version. This sample demonstrates my ability to effectively communicate complex technical information to various audiences, including developers, testers, and end-users. The release notes are structured in a user-friendly format, allowing readers to quickly identify and understand the changes implemented in the software.

## User Manuals
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The user manuals that I have worked on are materials that contain valuable proprietary information and are meant solely for internal use. However, I am more than willing to provide you with a sample that I have personally worked on. This sample can provide insights into the structure, formatting, and general content that could be useful in developing a user manual.
Included in my portfolio is a sample user manual for a banking application. This user manual showcases my ability to translate complex technical concepts into user-friendly documentation. It covers topics such as installation, login and authentication, dashboard navigation, funds transfer, bill payments, deposits and withdrawals, account management, support information, and frequently asked questions (FAQs). This sample user manual demonstrates my commitment to delivering comprehensive and easy-to-understand documentation that enhances the user experience. Feel free to explore the user manual sample to gain insights into my technical writing capabilities.

## XML
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project showcases my proficiency in transforming structured XML content into HTML format using XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) and styling it with CSS. The focus is on creating an article discussing the similarities, Pros and COons of two content management platforms, Confluence and SharePoint using necessary images and tables.
### Project Components
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**XML Content:** The project includes structured XML files [Conflunece and SharePoint.xml](https://github.com/vyshnavigu/Technical-Writer-Portfolio---Vyshnavi-Gurram/blob/main/XML/Confluence%20and%20SharePoint.xml) containing detailed content on Confluence and SharePoint, including introduction, similarities, pros and cons, and conclusion.
**XSLT Stylesheet:** A custom [Conflunece and SharePoint.xsl](https://github.com/vyshnavigu/Technical-Writer-Portfolio---Vyshnavi-Gurram/blob/main/XML/Confluence%20and%20SharePoint.xsl) file is employed to transform the structured XML content into well-formatted HTML output. This includes rendering images, tables, and text formatting to ensure clarity.
**CSS Styling:** The [style.css](https://github.com/vyshnavigu/Technical-Writer-Portfolio---Vyshnavi-Gurram/blob/main/XML/Style.css) file enhances the HTML output with defined fonts, colors, margins, and other visual aspects.
**Images:** Image [C&SL.jpg](https://github.com/vyshnavigu/Technical-Writer-Portfolio---Vyshnavi-Gurram/blob/main/XML/C%26SL.jpg) has been referenced within the XML content and displayed in the HTML output to enhance the article.
### Oxygen XML Editor
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have used Oxygen XML Editor to apply Transaformation Scenarios on the Conflunece and SharePoint.xml to convert XML content into HTML, which resulted in the output [Confluence and SharePoint.html](https://github.com/vyshnavigu/Technical-Writer-Portfolio---Vyshnavi-Gurram/blob/main/XML/Confluence%20and%20SharePoint.html).
The transformed HTML output can be viewed in any standard web browser, providing a user-friendly interface. The structured layout, complemented by CSS styling and visual aids, enhances understanding and engagement for readers.
