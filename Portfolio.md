# Portfolio
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am an experienced technical writer with a strong background in creating clear and concise documentation for software projects. With a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of complex technical concepts, I specialize in producing design documents, user manuals, API documents, installation guides, and release notes. Through my work, I aim to empower users and developers by providing them with comprehensive and user-friendly documentation. Below are some samples of my work, that give an idea of my style and skills.
## Design Documents
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These documents contain sensitive information owned by the company and are subject to strict confidentiality agreements. However, I would be more than happy to provide you with a sample template that I have personally worked on. This template can give you a general idea of the design elements and structure that I have experience with. While it may not encompass the specific details of the confidential documents, it can still serve as a helpful reference to understand my work.

## API Documents
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although I don't have extensive experience with API documentation, I am a dedicated self-learner who has taken the initiative to explore this field. Recently, I have been teaching myself API documentation techniques and tools, including Swagger. I even created a sample API documentation using Swagger and successfully published it. This hands-on experience has fueled my enthusiasm and passion for API documentation. I am a proactive individual who actively seeks opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in this domain. As an avid learner, I am excited to continue exploring and mastering API documentation to contribute effectively in this field.
