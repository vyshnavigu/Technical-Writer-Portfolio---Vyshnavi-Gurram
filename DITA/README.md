# DITA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This DITA project aims to provide a comprehensive guide to fundamental Python commands suitable for learners of all levels. The content is structured using DITA (Darwin Information Typing Architecture), organized with a ditamap, and styled for PDF output using CSS.
### Project Components
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **DITA Files:** The project contains [Topics](https://github.com/vyshnavigu/Technical-Writer-Portfolio---Vyshnavi-Gurram/tree/main/DITA/Topics) folder, that includes DITA files structured with a ditamap [fundamental_python_commands_for_everyone.ditamap](https://github.com/vyshnavigu/Technical-Writer-Portfolio---Vyshnavi-Gurram/blob/main/DITA/Topics/fundamental_python_commands_for_everyone.ditamap) to organize content systematically.
- **CSS Styling:** The [Custom.css](https://github.com/vyshnavigu/Technical-Writer-Portfolio---Vyshnavi-Gurram/blob/main/DITA/Topics/Custom.css) file enhances the PDF output with defined fonts, colors, margins, and other visual aspects.
### Oxygen XML Editor
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have used Oxygen XML Editor to apply Transaformation Scenarios on the fundamental_python_commands_for_Everyone.ditamap to convert the dita files into PDF, which resulted in the output [fundamental_python_commands_for_everyone.pdf](https://github.com/vyshnavigu/Technical-Writer-Portfolio---Vyshnavi-Gurram/blob/main/DITA/Out/pdf/fundamental_python_commands_for_everyone.pdf).
