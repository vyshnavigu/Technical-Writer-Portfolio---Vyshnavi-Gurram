# XML
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project showcases my proficiency in transforming structured XML content into HTML format using XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) and styling it with CSS. The focus is on creating an article discussing the similarities, Pros and COons of two content management platforms, Confluence and SharePoint using necessary images and tables.
### Project Components
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **XML Content:** The project includes structured XML files [Conflunece and SharePoint.xml](https://github.com/vyshnavigu/Technical-Writer-Portfolio---Vyshnavi-Gurram/blob/main/XML/Confluence%20and%20SharePoint.xml) containing detailed content on Confluence and SharePoint, including introduction, similarities, pros and cons, and conclusion.
- **XSLT Stylesheet:** A custom [Conflunece and SharePoint.xsl](https://github.com/vyshnavigu/Technical-Writer-Portfolio---Vyshnavi-Gurram/blob/main/XML/Confluence%20and%20SharePoint.xsl) file is employed to transform the structured XML content into well-formatted HTML output. This includes rendering images, tables, and text formatting to ensure clarity.
- **CSS Styling:** The [Style.css](https://github.com/vyshnavigu/Technical-Writer-Portfolio---Vyshnavi-Gurram/blob/main/XML/Style.css) file enhances the HTML output with defined fonts, colors, margins, and other visual aspects.
- **Images:** Image [C&SL.jpg](https://github.com/vyshnavigu/Technical-Writer-Portfolio---Vyshnavi-Gurram/blob/main/XML/C%26SL.jpg) has been referenced within the XML content and displayed in the HTML output to enhance the article.
### Oxygen XML Editor
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have used Oxygen XML Editor to apply Transaformation Scenarios on the Conflunece and SharePoint.xml to convert XML content into HTML, which resulted in the output [Confluence and SharePoint.html](https://github.com/vyshnavigu/Technical-Writer-Portfolio---Vyshnavi-Gurram/blob/main/XML/Confluence%20and%20SharePoint.html).
The transformed HTML output can be viewed in any standard web browser, providing a user-friendly interface. The structured layout, complemented by CSS styling and visual aids, enhances understanding and engagement for readers.
